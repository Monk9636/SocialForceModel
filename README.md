Social Force Model - Python library for pedestrian dynamics
===========================================================

Microsimulator solving for the free-space dynamics of pedestrians using a so-called "Social Force
Model" based on the article [Helbing & Molnar Phys. Rev. E 51, 4282 (1995)]. It includes the possibility 
to set a crude model of environment using defined walls and buildings.

- Includes JSON user interface for time-propagation and environmental settings.
- Includes pedestrian dynamics by solving time-dependent "Social Force Model" equations.

Installation
============

C++ core
--------

To build and install the C++ core, in the ``cpp/`` directory, run::

  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake ..
  make install

Requirements:

- Git
- Python and Numpy, Scipy dependencies
- JSON

The following instructions are for a Unix-like environment without 
root privileges.

In a terminal,

```sh
mkdir SocialForceModel
cd SocialForceModel
git clone https://github.com/UCLGuichard/SocialForceModel
```

This gets the code. Now let's run it.

```sh
cd SocialForceModel/src
python SocialForceModel.py
```

If all went well, you should now have a test case running.

***SocialForceModel has been developed and tested under Windows and Eclipse IDE with Python 2.7 and Anaconda interpreters.***
